# Cursed Objects
This script got it's name from **Jujutsu Kaisen**, yet I do not know why I did so. 

### Upcoming update
Into an new project called Cursed Spirits, the older one Cursed Objects will receive an power spike enhancement.

Cursed Spirit will be at least 10 times more powerful than Cursed Objects. It will be published into ``Pix4Devs/CursedSpirits``

Release: ``After 100 stars``
